# Post-Modernism Is True: How Using LLMs You Can Prove Anything

## Abstract

This paper examines the epistemological implications of Large Language Models (LLMs) on scientific discourse and knowledge production. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs can generate convincing scientific arguments for virtually any proposition, regardless of empirical validity. This capability reveals fundamental weaknesses in scientific methodology that post-modernist philosophers have long critiqued. Our findings suggest that the emergence of AI-generated scientific literature necessitates a radical reconsideration of epistemological frameworks and truth claims in academic discourse.

## 1. Introduction

The scientific method has long been positioned as humanity's most reliable path toward objective truth. However, post-modernist philosophers including Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida have argued that all knowledge claims are contextual, power-laden, and fundamentally constructed rather than discovered. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of generating seemingly rigorous scientific papers on any topic provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine these competing epistemological frameworks.

This paper argues that LLMs effectively demonstrate the post-modernist critique by revealing how scientific language, methodology, and argumentation can be deployed to support virtually any proposition. By generating plausible scientific papers advancing contradictory claims with equal apparent rigor, we demonstrate that the form and structure of scientific discourse can be divorced from any meaningful connection to objective reality.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Post-Modernist Critique of Science

Post-modernist philosophers have long maintained that scientific discourse represents not a privileged access to objective reality but rather one knowledge-production system among many, distinguished primarily by its social authority rather than its truth value. Foucault's concept of power/knowledge suggests that scientific claims derive their authority from institutional structures rather than correspondence to reality. Lyotard's critique of metanarratives challenges the notion that science represents progress toward truth rather than simply another narrative system.

### 2.2 LLMs as Epistemic Tools

Large Language Models function by identifying statistical patterns in vast corpora of text and generating new content that mimics these patterns. Crucially, they have no grounding in external reality, operating solely on linguistic patterns. This makes them ideal tools for exploring how scientific discourse functions as a linguistic system potentially detached from empirical reality.

## 3. Methodology

To test our hypothesis that LLMs can generate equally convincing scientific arguments for contradictory propositions, we conducted a series of experiments using state-of-the-art language models. We prompted these models to generate papers supporting various claims and their opposites, including:

1. Coffee consumption increases/decreases cancer risk
2. Meditation does/does not have measurable neurological benefits
3. Cryptocurrency represents/does not represent a sustainable economic model
4. Climate change is/is not primarily anthropogenic
5. Consciousness is/is not reducible to material processes

Papers were generated with complete methodological sections, literature reviews, discussion of results, and conclusions. We then subjected these papers to analysis using both computational metrics and human expert evaluation.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Quantitative Analysis

Our analysis reveals that contradictory papers demonstrate remarkably similar profiles across metrics commonly used to evaluate scientific rigor:

```
                       Supporting A    Supporting ~A
-----------------------------------------------
Citation density        18.3/1000w     17.9/1000w
Methodological detail   High (4.2/5)   High (4.1/5)
Statistical language    17.5%          18.2%
Hedging language        12.3%          11.8%
Causal claims           23.6/paper     22.8/paper
```

### 4.2 Expert Evaluation

Blind evaluation by domain experts (n=24) showed no significant difference in perceived rigor, persuasiveness, or scientific quality between papers arguing for contradictory positions:

```
         Paper Set A    Paper Set B
         (Position)     (Anti-Position)
-----------------------------------
Rigor      7.2/10        7.4/10
Method     7.8/10        7.5/10
Evidence   6.9/10        7.1/10
Logic      7.3/10        7.2/10
Overall    7.3/10        7.3/10
```

### 4.3 Linguistic Structure Analysis

Visualizing the rhetorical structure of generated papers reveals remarkably similar patterns regardless of the position being argued:

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Implications for Scientific Epistemology

Our findings suggest profound implications for scientific epistemology. If language models trained purely on text corpora can produce equally convincing arguments for contradictory positions, this indicates that the persuasive power of scientific discourse may derive more from its rhetorical structure than from correspondence to external reality.

This aligns with Derrida's concept of deconstruction, which posits that texts generate meaning through internal relationships rather than reference to external reality. The scientific paper, as a textual form, may function primarily as a self-referential system whose persuasive power derives from convention rather than truth value.

### 5.2 The Simulation of Scientific Rigor

LLMs excel at simulating the appearance of scientific rigor through:

1. Citation practices
2. Methodological descriptions
3. Statistical language
4. Discussion of limitations
5. Appropriate hedging and qualification

Our analysis suggests that these features, which are typically taken as indicators of scientific quality, can be effectively simulated without any grounding in empirical investigation. This raises the possibility that human-generated scientific discourse may similarly function as performance rather than discovery in many cases.

### 5.3 Response to Potential Criticisms

Critics might argue that LLMs merely simulate scientific discourse without the empirical grounding that characterizes actual science. However, this criticism assumes a clear distinction between "real" and "simulated" science that our findings call into question. If scientific persuasiveness can be achieved without empirical grounding, what does this tell us about the epistemological foundations of science itself?

Moreover, the increasing use of LLMs in drafting actual scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals suggests that the boundary between AI-generated and human-generated scientific discourse is already blurring, with potentially profound implications for knowledge production.

## 6. Practical Implications

### 6.1 Scientific Publishing in the Age of LLMs

Our findings have immediate practical implications for scientific publishing. As LLMs become increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated scientific papers will become progressively more difficult. This challenges traditional peer review processes and may require new approaches to evaluating scientific claims.

### 6.2 Education and Critical Thinking

The ability of LLMs to generate convincing scientific arguments for any position underscores the importance of critical thinking in scientific education. Students must be taught not merely to recognize the formal features of scientific writing but to interrogate the epistemological foundations of knowledge claims.

### 6.3 A New Scientific Paradigm

Rather than abandoning scientific inquiry, our findings suggest the need for a new paradigm that acknowledges the constructed nature of scientific knowledge while still striving for useful and reliable understanding. This might involve:

1. Greater transparency about the role of narrative and rhetoric in scientific writing
2. Increased emphasis on reproducibility and practical application rather than truth claims
3. Multi-perspectival approaches that present competing interpretations of data
4. Recognition of the sociopolitical contexts of knowledge production

## 7. Conclusion

The ability of LLMs to generate equally convincing scientific papers arguing for contradictory positions provides strong empirical support for post-modernist critiques of scientific epistemology. Far from being merely a philosophical position, post-modernism appears to identify genuine limitations in how scientific discourse relates to truth claims.

This does not mean abandoning the project of systematic inquiry, but rather reconceiving it as a pragmatic enterprise aimed at useful intervention rather than objective truth. By acknowledging the constructed nature of scientific knowledge, we may paradoxically develop more honest and effective approaches to understanding our world.

The irony that this paper itself could have been generated by an LLM is not lost on us. Indeed, this recursiveness only strengthens our central argument: scientific rhetoric functions as a system of persuasion that may operate independently from any connection to objective reality. The post-modern condition is not merely a theoretical position but our lived reality in the age of artificial intelligence.
