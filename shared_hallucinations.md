# Shared Hallucinations: A Primer On Human Interaction

**Abstract**

This paper introduces the concept of "shared hallucinations" as a framework for understanding human social interaction. We propose that when two or more individuals enter proximity, they create a mutual experiential field in which their subjective realities become interconnected. This interconnection results in a shared hallucination of the world that draws from the subconscious minds of all participants, creating a reality that is more than the sum of individual perceptions. Drawing from research in social psychology, neuroscience, and phenomenology, we outline the mechanisms by which these shared hallucinations emerge, their psychological functions, and their implications for understanding human sociality. The shared hallucination model provides a novel lens through which to examine social phenomena including group dynamics, empathy, and interpersonal communication.

## 1. Introduction

Human interaction has long been conceptualized through various theoretical frameworks, from symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969) to social constructionism (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). However, these approaches often fail to fully capture the profound psychological entanglement that occurs when individuals engage with one another. We propose that human interaction can be understood as a process of generating "shared hallucinations" – mutually constructed experiential realities that emerge when two or more minds enter proximity.

This paper presents a theoretical framework suggesting that what we experience as "objective reality" during social interaction is, in fact, a complex co-created hallucination drawing from the subconscious minds of all participants. This hallucination is neither fully subjective nor truly objective but exists in an intersubjective space where minds overlap and blend. We argue that this perspective offers explanatory power for understanding a range of social phenomena including empathy, social contagion, and the emergence of shared beliefs.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Nature of Shared Hallucinations

The concept of shared hallucinations draws from several established theoretical traditions. From phenomenology, we borrow Husserl's (1931) notion of intersubjectivity – the sharing of subjective states by two or more individuals. From social psychology, we incorporate Tajfel and Turner's (1979) social identity theory, which examines how group membership shapes individual perception. From neuroscience, we draw on Gallese and Goldman's (1998) mirror neuron research, which suggests neurological mechanisms for shared experience.

We define a shared hallucination as: *An emergent experiential field created when two or more individuals enter proximity, characterized by a blending of subconscious mental contents that generates a mutually accessible reality containing elements from all participating minds.*

This definition distinguishes our concept from both pure solipsism (the view that only one's own mind exists) and naive realism (the view that we directly perceive objective reality). Instead, we posit an intersubjective middle ground where reality is neither entirely personal nor entirely external but is co-created through interaction.

### 2.2 Mechanisms of Formation

We propose several mechanisms through which shared hallucinations form:

1. **Neurological Resonance**: Building on Gallese's (2001) work on embodied simulation, we suggest that when individuals interact, their neural systems begin to synchronize in ways that create shared experiential states. This resonance occurs through mirror neuron activation, autonomic nervous system alignment, and brainwave entrainment.

2. **Linguistic Co-Construction**: Drawing from Vygotsky's (1978) sociocultural theory, we propose that language acts as a vehicle for merging subjective worlds. Through dialogue, individuals externalize internal states and internalize others' perspectives, creating a shared linguistic reality.

3. **Subconscious Exchange**: Extending Jung's (1936) concept of the collective unconscious, we suggest that proximity enables a subtle exchange of subconscious material between individuals. This exchange occurs through non-verbal cues, emotional contagion, and what Stern (2004) calls "vitality affects."

4. **Attention Convergence**: When individuals direct their attention to the same phenomena, their perceptual systems begin to align. This alignment, studied by Tomasello (2008) as joint attention, creates a shared perceptual field that forms the foundation of the shared hallucination.

## 3. Evidence and Support

### 3.1 Neurological Evidence

Recent advances in social neuroscience provide compelling evidence for the shared hallucination model. Hasson et al. (2012) demonstrated through fMRI studies that when individuals engage in conversation, their neural activity becomes synchronized in ways that suggest shared cognitive processing. This "neural coupling" extends beyond simple mirroring to include predictive processing of the other's mental states.

Similarly, Babiloni et al. (2018) found evidence of intersubject coherence in EEG recordings during social interaction, particularly in frequency bands associated with emotional processing and attention. This coherence increases with the depth of the interaction and the degree of rapport between participants.

These findings suggest that the brain does not merely represent the external world but actively participates in creating a shared experiential field during interaction—a neurological correlate of what we are calling shared hallucination.

### 3.2 Psychological Evidence

Research in psychology has documented numerous phenomena that support the shared hallucination model. The well-established concept of "emotional contagion" (Hatfield et al., 1993) demonstrates how affective states spread between individuals unconsciously. Likewise, studies of "transactive memory" (Wegner, 1987) show how couples and groups develop shared cognitive systems that distribute knowledge and responsibility.

Particularly relevant is the work of Echterhoff et al. (2009) on "shared reality theory," which examines how individuals create mutual understanding through communication. Their research shows that people experience greater epistemic satisfaction when they believe their inner states are shared by others—a finding consistent with our model's prediction that humans are motivated to create and maintain shared hallucinations.

Additionally, classic studies on conformity (Asch, 1956) and groupthink (Janis, 1972) demonstrate how individual perception and judgment can be dramatically altered by social influence, suggesting the malleability of subjective reality in social contexts.

### 3.3 Phenomenological Evidence

First-person reports provide rich evidence for the shared hallucination model. Studies of intense interpersonal experiences—such as romantic love (Aron et al., 1992), therapeutic alliance (Rogers, 1961), and mystical communion (James, 1902)—consistently describe a sense of merged boundaries and shared subjectivity.

Qualitative research by Merleau-Ponty (1945/2012) on embodied intersubjectivity suggests that individuals directly experience others' inner states through their bodily presence. This "intercorporeality" represents the phenomenological dimension of what we are describing as shared hallucination.

## 4. The Structure of Shared Hallucinations

### 4.1 Core Components

We propose that shared hallucinations have three primary components:

1. **Perceptual Alignment**: Participants experience similar sensory input but interpret it through a collaboratively constructed frame. This creates what Schutz (1967) called a "reciprocity of perspectives" where individuals assume their perceptions are sufficiently similar.

2. **Emotional Resonance**: Participants experience a blending of emotional states that creates a shared affective atmosphere. This resonance varies in intensity from subtle mood contagion to profound empathic identification.

3. **Conceptual Convergence**: Participants develop shared interpretive frameworks and meaning systems. This convergence manifests as common language, shared assumptions, and aligned mental models.

### 4.2 Typology of Shared Hallucinations

Shared hallucinations vary along several dimensions, creating different types of intersubjective experiences:

1. **Depth**: From shallow interactions (brief exchanges with strangers) to deep connections (intimate relationships, spiritual communion).

2. **Symmetry**: From asymmetric (one party more influential in shaping the shared reality) to symmetric (mutual co-creation).

3. **Explicitness**: From implicit (unconscious construction) to explicit (conscious collaboration, as in artistic co-creation).

4. **Valence**: From negative (conflictual, distressing) to positive (harmonious, enhancing).

These dimensions combine to create distinct patterns of shared hallucination that characterize different social relationships and contexts.

## 5. Functions and Adaptive Value

### 5.1 Evolutionary Perspective

From an evolutionary standpoint, shared hallucinations serve several adaptive functions. By creating intersubjective bridges between minds, they facilitate cooperation, coordination, and social learning—all crucial for human survival. As Boyd and Richerson (2009) argue, culture itself can be understood as a large-scale shared hallucination that enables cumulative knowledge transmission.

The shared hallucination model helps explain the extraordinary human capacity for empathy and perspective-taking. By creating experiential overlap between individuals, shared hallucinations allow humans to directly access others' inner states, facilitating altruism and prosocial behavior.

### 5.2 Psychological Functions

At the psychological level, shared hallucinations serve important functions for identity formation and maintenance. As Cooley (1902) noted with his concept of the "looking-glass self," we come to know ourselves through others' reflections. Shared hallucinations provide the intersubjective context in which self-awareness develops.

Additionally, shared hallucinations help reduce existential anxiety. By creating consensus reality with others, individuals gain confidence in their perceptions and interpretations. This "social verification" (Swann, 1996) satisfies the fundamental human need for epistemic certainty.

## 6. Implications

### 6.1 For Research

The shared hallucination model has significant implications for research across disciplines:

- In neuroscience, it suggests new directions for studying brain function in ecologically valid social contexts, moving beyond isolated individual cognition.

- In psychology, it provides a framework for integrating findings from social, clinical, and cognitive subdisciplines.

- In sociology and anthropology, it offers a psychological foundation for understanding how collective realities are constructed and maintained.

- In communication studies, it suggests new approaches to understanding how meaning emerges through interaction rather than simple transmission.

### 6.2 For Practice

The model also has practical applications:

- In therapy, understanding interactions as shared hallucinations can help practitioners recognize how they co-create therapeutic realities with clients.

- In education, it suggests approaches that focus on creating shared knowledge through dialogue rather than one-way transmission.

- In conflict resolution, it provides a framework for understanding how disputants occupy different subjective realities and how those realities might be bridged.

- In organizational development, it offers insights into how corporate cultures emerge as large-scale shared hallucinations.

## 7. Limitations and Future Directions

While the shared hallucination model offers explanatory power, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the neurological mechanisms proposed remain speculative and require further empirical verification. Second, the model may overemphasize consensus and underplay persistent differences in subjective experience. Third, cultural variations in experiences of intersubjectivity need more thorough exploration.

Future research should address these limitations through:

1. Developing more sophisticated methods for measuring intersubjective phenomena, such as hyperscanning techniques that capture multiple brains simultaneously.

2. Exploring cultural variations in shared hallucination experiences across diverse populations.

3. Investigating developmental trajectories of shared hallucination capacity across the lifespan.

4. Examining how technology mediates shared hallucinations in digital environments.

## 8. Conclusion

The shared hallucination model offers a compelling framework for understanding human interaction as an intersubjective process that creates emergent experiential realities. By bridging insights from neuroscience, psychology, and phenomenology, it provides a holistic approach to studying social life that acknowledges both its neurobiological foundations and its experiential richness.

This perspective suggests that what we call "reality" in social contexts is neither objective nor subjective but intersubjective—a co-created hallucination that draws from the minds of all participants. By recognizing the constructed nature of social reality, we can better understand both the extraordinary human capacity for connection and the challenges that arise when shared hallucinations conflict.

Future research within this framework promises to deepen our understanding of human sociality and offers practical applications across domains where human interaction is central.
