# Everything is an Abstraction Pointing to an Experience: A Phenomenological Analysis

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel phenomenological framework positing that all cognitive constructs, from language to scientific models, fundamentally serve as abstractions that reference experiential phenomena. Through examination of cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophical phenomenology, we argue that meaning-making processes invariably connect abstract representations to lived experiences. This perspective has significant implications for epistemology, consciousness studies, and information processing theories. We propose that recognizing the experiential foundations of abstraction could resolve longstanding philosophical problems regarding knowledge acquisition and representation.

## 1. Introduction

Human understanding operates through a complex interplay between direct experience and abstract representation. The assertion that "everything is an abstraction pointing to an experience" challenges traditional epistemological frameworks that often privilege either rationalist or empiricist approaches in isolation (Husserl, 1970; Merleau-Ponty, 1962). This paper examines how abstractions—linguistic symbols, mathematical formulations, scientific theories, and cultural constructs—derive their meaning and utility from their capacity to reference, organize, and communicate experiential phenomena.

The relationship between abstraction and experience has been explored across diverse disciplines, from philosophy of mind (Chalmers, 1996) to cognitive linguistics (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980) and computational neuroscience (Friston, 2010). However, these investigations typically remain constrained within their respective disciplinary boundaries. This paper attempts a unified analysis that integrates these perspectives through a phenomenological lens.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 Phenomenological Foundations

Phenomenology, as developed by Husserl (1970) and extended by Merleau-Ponty (1962) and Heidegger (1962), emphasizes the primacy of lived experience in constituting meaning. Husserl's concept of "intentionality"—that consciousness is always consciousness *of* something—establishes the inherent relationship between mental states and their experiential referents. Merleau-Ponty's embodied cognition framework further grounds abstraction in bodily experience, arguing that even the most abstract concepts derive from sensorimotor engagement with the world.

### 2.2 Cognitive Linguistics and Embodied Abstraction

Lakoff and Johnson's (1980, 1999) work on conceptual metaphor demonstrates how abstract concepts are systematically structured through metaphorical mappings from embodied, experiential domains. Their research shows that abstract concepts like time, causation, and morality are comprehended through metaphorical extension of physical experiences (e.g., time as movement through space). This supports our central thesis that abstractions function as referential frameworks pointing to experiential foundations.

### 2.3 Information Theory Perspectives

From an information-theoretic standpoint, abstractions can be understood as compression mechanisms that reduce experiential complexity to manageable representations (Shannon, 1948; Bateson, 1972). Friston's (2010) free energy principle suggests that cognitive systems model their environments through predictive processing, creating abstractions that minimize prediction error based on experiential interactions. These abstractions serve as efficient encodings of experiential patterns rather than autonomous entities.

## 3. The Abstraction-Experience Nexus

### 3.1 Language as Experiential Indexing

Language represents perhaps the most sophisticated abstraction system humans employ. While traditional linguistic theories often treat language as a self-contained symbolic system (Chomsky, 1965), more recent approaches emphasize its grounding in experience. Wittgenstein's (1953) later philosophy rejects the picture theory of meaning in favor of understanding language as embedded in "forms of life"—experiential contexts that give words their meaning. Similarly, enactive approaches to language (Di Paolo et al., 2018) view linguistic competence as emerging from patterns of embodied interaction rather than abstract rule-following.

### 3.2 Scientific Models as Experiential Maps

Scientific theories and models, despite their mathematical formality, ultimately derive their epistemic value from their capacity to organize and predict experiential phenomena. As Kuhn (1962) demonstrated, paradigm shifts in science often involve reconceptualizing experiential data rather than merely accumulating facts. This view aligns with pragmatist philosophies of science (James, 1907; Dewey, 1929) that evaluate theoretical constructs based on their practical consequences in experiential domains.

### 3.3 Cultural and Social Abstractions

Social constructs, institutional frameworks, and cultural narratives function as collective abstractions that organize shared experiences. Berger and Luckmann's (1966) social constructionism describes how socially constructed knowledge becomes "objectified" through institutional practices yet remains fundamentally connected to lived experience. Similarly, Bourdieu's (1977) concept of "habitus" demonstrates how social abstractions become embodied in experiential dispositions.

### 3.4 Mythological and Religious Abstractions

Mythological and religious entities—such as elves, witches, unicorns, gods, angels, and demons—represent particularly illuminating examples of abstractions pointing to experiences. These entities, despite their apparent ontological discontinuity with everyday reality, derive their meaning and cultural persistence from their capacity to organize and represent specific domains of human experience.

For instance, elves and fairies in folklore often represent unexplained natural phenomena or embody the mysterious aspects of natural environments (Briggs, 1976). The witch archetype frequently symbolizes feared aspects of feminine power and knowledge outside patriarchal control, encoding social anxieties and experiences of marginalization (Federici, 2004). Unicorns, with their purity associations, abstract qualities of unreachable perfection and innocence that reflect human aspirations and moral experiences (Shepard, 1996).

Religious abstractions function similarly but often with greater cultural elaboration. The concept of God across traditions abstracts experiences of awe, transcendence, moral authority, and cosmic order (Otto, 1923; Eliade, 1959). Angels personify experiences of guidance, protection, and benevolent intervention, while demons encode experiences of temptation, moral struggle, and the perceived origins of suffering and evil (Russell, 1986).

This pattern extends across diverse mythological systems worldwide, each developing distinct abstractions that reflect particular experiential domains within their cultural contexts:

In Greek mythology, the pantheon of gods represents abstractions of natural forces and human attributes elevated to cosmic significance. Zeus embodies experiences of authority, power, and meteorological phenomena; Aphrodite abstracts experiences of love, beauty, and desire; Apollo represents experiences of rationality, artistic inspiration, and healing; while Dionysus encapsulates experiences of ecstatic release, intoxication, and dissolution of social boundaries (Burkert, 1985). Each deity functions as a compressed representation of experiential patterns encountered within Hellenic culture.

Hindu mythology presents a particularly rich example of experiential abstraction, where deities like Vishnu, Shiva, and Shakti represent fundamental cosmic principles while simultaneously embodying specific experiential domains. Shiva, for instance, abstracts the tension between creation and destruction, representing experiences of transformation, asceticism, and cosmic dance (O'Flaherty, 1981). The multiplicity of forms these deities assume (avatars) further illustrates the flexible mapping between abstraction and experience, as each avatar addresses different experiential contexts while maintaining conceptual continuity.

Chinese mythology and cosmology, with its emphasis on balance and complementary forces, abstracts experiences of natural cycles, social harmony, and personal cultivation. The concepts of yin and yang abstract the experience of complementary opposites permeating all aspects of existence, while figures like the Eight Immortals personify aspirational experiences of transcending ordinary human limitations (Yang, 2005). The dragon, unlike its Western counterpart, abstracts experiences of beneficial power, fertility, and water-related phenomena (Visser, 1913).

Japanese Shinto presents kami as abstractions of experiential encounters with the sacred in natural phenomena, ancestral presences, and extraordinary events. Each kami represents the abstraction of awe-inspiring qualities perceived within particular locations, objects, or natural forces, demonstrating how direct experiential encounters become formalized into religious abstractions (Kasulis, 2004). The interrelationship between Japanese Buddhism and Shinto further illustrates how abstraction systems can merge and differentiate based on evolving experiential contexts.

Indigenous mythologies worldwide similarly abstract experiential patterns tied to local environments and social structures. Native American traditions frequently abstract experiences with animal powers and qualities through totemic relationships (Lévi-Strauss, 1962); Australian Aboriginal Dreamtime narratives abstract experiences of landscape features and their connection to ancestral activities (Munn, 1973); and African traditional religions abstract experiences of communal continuity through ancestor veneration (Mbiti, 1990).

These abstractions persist not merely as arbitrary cultural inventions but because they successfully organize and give meaning to recurring patterns of human experience. Through these mythological and religious frameworks, complex experiential domains related to mortality, morality, community boundaries, and encounters with the unknown become comprehensible and communicable. This aligns with Durkheim's (1912) observation that religious concepts, however supernatural they may appear, ultimately represent social realities and collective experiences in abstracted form.

Across these diverse traditions, a common pattern emerges: mythological abstractions achieve cultural persistence when they effectively index, organize, and communicate significant experiential domains. Their variation across cultures reflects differences in environmental contexts, historical experiences, and social structures, while their commonalities point to shared aspects of human experiential engagement with the world.

## 4. Epistemological Implications

### 4.1 Resolving the Representation Problem

The view that abstractions point to experiences offers a potential resolution to the "representation problem" in epistemology—the question of how mental representations relate to external reality (Rorty, 1979). Rather than assuming a problematic correspondence between representation and an independent reality, our framework suggests that representations derive their meaning from their function within experiential contexts. This aligns with enactivist approaches to cognition (Varela et al., 1991) that reject representation in favor of embodied, experiential sense-making.

### 4.2 Experiential Grounding of Knowledge

If abstractions derive their meaning from experiential referents, then knowledge acquisition necessarily involves experiential engagement. This has significant implications for educational theory and practice, suggesting that abstract learning should be systematically connected to concrete experiences (Kolb, 1984; Dewey, 1938). Similarly, in scientific methodology, this perspective supports approaches that acknowledge the role of experiential factors in theory formation and evaluation (Polanyi, 1958).

## 5. Applications and Extensions

### 5.1 Artificial Intelligence and Computational Cognition

The abstraction-experience framework suggests limitations in purely symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence. Systems that manipulate abstractions without experiential grounding may face fundamental barriers to achieving human-like understanding (Searle, 1980; Dreyfus, 1992). Recent advances in embodied AI and robotics (Brooks, 1991; Pfeifer & Bongard, 2006) that ground computation in sensorimotor interaction align with our perspective, as do approaches to machine learning that incorporate experiential data rather than purely formal operations.

### 5.2 Consciousness Studies

The relationship between abstraction and experience has profound implications for theories of consciousness. If consciousness fundamentally involves experiential qualia (Nagel, 1974; Chalmers, 1996), then attempts to fully reduce consciousness to abstract computational or neurobiological models may be inherently limited. Our framework suggests that understanding consciousness requires acknowledging the irreducible nature of experience while recognizing how abstract models can usefully organize and predict experiential patterns.

## 6. Conclusion

This paper has argued that abstractions—from linguistic symbols to scientific theories—function fundamentally as referential frameworks pointing toward experiential phenomena. This perspective integrates insights from phenomenology, cognitive science, linguistics, and information theory to offer a unified account of how meaning emerges from the abstraction-experience nexus. By recognizing the experiential foundations of abstraction, we can develop more nuanced approaches to epistemology, consciousness studies, artificial intelligence, and education.

The framework presented here suggests several directions for future research, including empirical investigations of how abstraction processes are grounded in neural correlates of experience, cross-cultural studies of abstraction-experience relationships, and pedagogical approaches that systematically connect abstract learning with experiential foundations. By reconceptualizing the relationship between abstraction and experience, we may develop more integrated approaches to fundamental questions across multiple disciplines.
