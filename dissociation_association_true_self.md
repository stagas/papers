# Dissociation is Association with True Self: Everything
## A Paradigmatic Reframing of Dissociative Experiences Through Buddhist and Contemplative Traditions

### Abstract

This paper proposes a radical reframing of dissociative experiences from pathological disconnection to transcendent association with the true self. Drawing from Buddhist psychology, Advaita Vedanta, and contemporary consciousness research, we argue that what Western psychology labels as "dissociation" may represent moments of authentic connection with our fundamental nature—the undifferentiated awareness that underlies all experience. Through analysis of contemplative traditions, neuroscientific findings, and phenomenological accounts, we demonstrate that dissociative states share striking similarities with meditative absorption, mystical experiences, and states of non-dual awareness described across cultures. This reframing has profound implications for therapeutic approaches, suggesting that rather than pathologizing these experiences, we might cultivate and integrate them as gateways to psychological wholeness and spiritual realization.

### Introduction

Western psychology has long characterized dissociation as a pathological disconnection from ordinary consciousness, typically arising from trauma or psychological distress (van der Kolk, 2014). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines dissociation as "a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). However, this framework may fundamentally misunderstand the nature of these experiences.

What if dissociation, rather than representing disconnection, actually represents the most profound form of connection possible—association with our true nature? This paper argues that many experiences labeled as dissociative in Western psychology correspond to what contemplative traditions have recognized for millennia as glimpses of our authentic being, the undifferentiated awareness that is our deepest identity.

The Buddha's teaching of *anatta* (non-self) points to the illusory nature of the separate self that we typically take ourselves to be (Rahula, 1974). Similarly, Advaita Vedanta speaks of the *Atman*—the true Self that is identical with universal consciousness (Deutsch, 1969). These traditions suggest that our ordinary sense of being a separate, bounded individual is itself a kind of dissociation from our true nature. From this perspective, what psychology calls dissociation might actually be moments of re-association with this fundamental ground of being.

### Theoretical Framework

#### The Illusion of the Separate Self

Buddhist psychology posits that the sense of being a separate, continuous self is a cognitive construction rather than an ultimate reality (Albahari, 2006). The *skandhas* (five aggregates)—form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness—are constantly changing processes that we mistakenly reify into a solid sense of self (Bodhi, 2000). This constructed self, while functionally useful, creates suffering through its inherent sense of separation and vulnerability.

Neuroscience supports this view, revealing that the sense of self emerges from the integration of multiple brain networks rather than residing in any single location (Damasio, 2010). The default mode network (DMN), particularly active during self-referential thinking, shows decreased activity during both meditative states and certain dissociative experiences (Brewer et al., 2011; Lanius et al., 2010).

#### Dissociation as Deidentification

From a contemplative perspective, what Western psychology terms dissociation may represent moments of deidentification from the constructed self. When the usual mechanisms of self-construction temporarily cease or weaken, consciousness may recognize its own nature more directly. This aligns with the phenomenology reported in dissociative experiences: a sense of observing oneself from outside, feeling unreal or dreamlike, or experiencing a profound shift in the sense of identity (Steinberg, 1995).

The Advaita teacher Nisargadatta Maharaj described this process: "You are not what you take yourself to be. Find out what you are. Watch the sense 'I am', find your real Self" (Maharaj, 1973). This instruction points to the possibility of recognizing awareness itself as our true identity, rather than the contents of awareness.

#### The Witness Consciousness

Many contemplative traditions speak of a witness consciousness—an unchanging awareness that observes all mental phenomena without being affected by them (Forman, 1998). In Kashmir Shaivism, this is called *sakshi-bhava* (witness-being), while in Vedanta it is known as *drashta* (the seer). This witness consciousness is characterized by:

1. **Unchanging presence** - It remains constant while all mental contents change
2. **Non-identification** - It observes without becoming identified with what it observes
3. **Spacious awareness** - It provides the "space" in which all experience occurs
4. **Peaceful detachment** - It maintains equanimity regardless of the content of experience

These characteristics closely parallel many descriptions of dissociative states, particularly depersonalization and derealization experiences (Sierra & David, 2011).

### Phenomenological Analysis

#### Depersonalization as Recognition of Pure Awareness

Depersonalization—the experience of feeling detached from oneself or one's mental processes—is often described in terms that mirror contemplative accounts of pure awareness. Individuals report feeling like they are "watching themselves from outside" or that their thoughts and emotions seem distant and unreal (Simeon & Abugel, 2006).

Consider this account from a meditation practitioner: "There was a sudden shift where 'I' was no longer the thinker of thoughts but the awareness in which thoughts appeared. The personal self felt like a character in a movie I was watching" (Austin, 1998). Compare this to a clinical description of depersonalization: "I feel like I'm watching myself from outside my body. My thoughts don't feel like they belong to me" (Sierra, 2009).

The similarity is striking. Both describe a shift from identification with mental contents to recognition of the awareness that perceives them. The key difference lies in the interpretive framework: one is seen as spiritual realization, the other as pathological dissociation.

#### Derealization and the Illusory Nature of Consensus Reality

Derealization—the experience that the external world seems unreal, dreamlike, or lacking in substance—parallels the Buddhist teaching of *maya* (illusion) and the Advaitic understanding that the phenomenal world is a projection of consciousness (Shankara, 788 CE/1978).

The Heart Sutra, a central Buddhist text, states: "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (Red Pine, 2004). This points to the insubstantial nature of what we take to be solid reality. Similarly, individuals experiencing derealization often report that the world seems "like a movie" or "not quite real" (Hunter et al., 2003).

From a contemplative perspective, derealization might represent a spontaneous recognition of the dreamlike nature of phenomenal experience. Rather than indicating pathology, it could signal a breakthrough in understanding the constructed nature of our perceived reality.

#### Dissociative Absorption and Meditative Samadhi

Dissociative absorption—becoming so absorbed in an activity or internal state that one loses awareness of surroundings—shares remarkable similarities with meditative *samadhi* (absorption states) described in Buddhist and Hindu traditions (Goleman, 1988).

The *jhanas* (absorption states) in Buddhist meditation are characterized by:
- Sustained attention on a single object
- Withdrawal from sensory awareness
- Profound states of peace and bliss
- Temporary cessation of discursive thinking
- Altered sense of time and space

These features closely match descriptions of positive dissociative experiences, such as those occurring during flow states, creative absorption, or spontaneous mystical experiences (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990).

### Neuroscientific Correlates

#### Default Mode Network Deactivation

Both meditative states and dissociative experiences show decreased activity in the default mode network (DMN), particularly the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (Brewer et al., 2011; Lanius et al., 2010). The DMN is associated with self-referential processing and the maintenance of a coherent sense of self across time.

This deactivation may represent a neurobiological correlate of the dissolution of the constructed self, allowing for the recognition of more fundamental aspects of consciousness. Rather than indicating dysfunction, DMN deactivation during dissociative states might reflect the brain's capacity for transcendent modes of awareness.

#### Altered Gamma Wave Activity

Both advanced meditators and individuals experiencing dissociative states show altered gamma wave activity (40-100 Hz), associated with heightened awareness and the binding of conscious experience (Lutz et al., 2004; Bob, 2008). This suggests that dissociative states may involve enhanced rather than diminished consciousness, albeit in a different configuration than ordinary waking awareness.

#### Neuroplasticity and Integration

Long-term meditation practice leads to structural brain changes associated with increased emotional regulation, attention, and self-awareness (Luders et al., 2009). Similarly, therapeutic approaches that help individuals integrate dissociative experiences show improvements in overall psychological functioning (Howell, 2005).

This suggests that rather than suppressing dissociative experiences, learning to understand and integrate them may promote psychological growth and neural integration.

### Cross-Cultural Perspectives

#### Shamanic Traditions

Indigenous shamanic traditions worldwide recognize altered states of consciousness as gateways to healing and spiritual insight (Eliade, 1964). Shamanic journeying often involves experiences that would be classified as dissociative in Western psychology: out-of-body experiences, encounters with non-ordinary beings, and profound shifts in identity and perception.

These traditions view such experiences not as pathological but as essential for accessing healing wisdom and maintaining community well-being. The shaman's ability to "dissociate" from ordinary consciousness is seen as a gift that benefits the entire community.

#### Tibetan Buddhism and Bardo States

Tibetan Buddhism describes intermediate states (*bardos*) between different modes of consciousness, including the bardo of dying and the bardo of becoming (Thurman, 1994). These states involve profound dissociation from ordinary identity and perception, yet they are viewed as opportunities for liberation rather than pathological conditions.

The *Bardo Thodol* (Tibetan Book of the Dead) provides detailed instructions for navigating these dissociative states, emphasizing the recognition of their empty, illusory nature as a path to awakening (Evans-Wentz, 1927/2000).

#### Sufi Mysticism and Fana

In Sufi tradition, *fana* (annihilation) represents the dissolution of the ego-self in divine consciousness (Chittick, 1989). This experience involves profound dissociation from ordinary identity, described as "dying before you die." Rather than being pathologized, fana is considered the ultimate goal of spiritual practice.

The 13th-century Sufi poet Rumi wrote: "Die! Die! Die in this love! If you die in this love, your soul will be renewed" (Barks, 1995). This points to dissociation from the false self as a prerequisite for recognizing one's true nature.

### Therapeutic Implications

#### Reframing Dissociation

This paradigmatic shift suggests that therapeutic approaches to dissociation might benefit from reframing these experiences as potentially meaningful rather than purely pathological. Rather than focusing solely on "grounding" techniques that return individuals to ordinary consciousness, therapy might also explore the insights and perspectives available within dissociative states.

This doesn't mean romanticizing all dissociative experiences or ignoring their potential distress. Rather, it suggests a more nuanced approach that distinguishes between:

1. **Traumatic dissociation** - Defensive disconnection from overwhelming experience
2. **Transcendent dissociation** - Spontaneous recognition of deeper aspects of consciousness
3. **Integrative dissociation** - Healthy flexibility in self-identification and perspective

#### Contemplative Psychotherapy

Emerging approaches in contemplative psychotherapy integrate mindfulness and awareness practices with traditional therapeutic methods (Germer et al., 2005). These approaches recognize that psychological healing often involves a fundamental shift in identity—from identification with thoughts and emotions to recognition of the awareness that perceives them.

Therapists trained in contemplative approaches can help clients:
- Develop a stable witness consciousness
- Explore the insights available within altered states
- Integrate transcendent experiences with daily functioning
- Cultivate healthy forms of deidentification

#### Mindfulness-Based Interventions

Research on mindfulness-based interventions shows significant benefits for individuals with dissociative symptoms (Keng et al., 2011). These practices teach individuals to observe their mental processes without becoming overwhelmed by them, developing the same witness consciousness described in contemplative traditions.

Rather than viewing dissociation as something to be eliminated, mindfulness approaches can help individuals develop a more skillful relationship with these states, recognizing them as opportunities for insight and growth.

### Case Studies and Clinical Applications

#### Case Study 1: Spontaneous Mystical Experience

Sarah, a 34-year-old teacher, experienced sudden onset of depersonalization following a period of intense stress. Rather than pathologizing her experience, her contemplatively-informed therapist helped her explore the insights available within this altered state.

Sarah reported: "At first it was terrifying—I felt like I was watching my life from outside. But as I learned to relax into it, I realized I was experiencing something profound. I could see how much of my suffering came from over-identification with my thoughts and emotions. There was this vast, peaceful awareness that was always there, underneath all the mental noise."

Through therapy that honored both the challenging and transcendent aspects of her experience, Sarah developed greater emotional resilience and a more flexible sense of identity.

#### Case Study 2: Integration of Trauma and Transcendence

Michael, a 28-year-old veteran, experienced dissociative episodes following combat trauma. His therapy integrated trauma-informed care with contemplative practices, helping him distinguish between defensive dissociation and moments of genuine transcendence.

"I learned that not all dissociation was the same," Michael explained. "Some of it was my mind protecting me from overwhelming memories. But some of it was actually showing me something important—that I was more than just my traumatic experiences. There was this part of me that was untouched by everything that happened."

This integrated approach helped Michael process his trauma while also recognizing the spiritual dimensions of his dissociative experiences.

### Research Directions

#### Phenomenological Studies

Future research should conduct detailed phenomenological analyses of dissociative experiences, comparing them with accounts of mystical and meditative states. This could help identify which aspects of dissociation might represent transcendent rather than pathological processes.

#### Neuroimaging Studies

Advanced neuroimaging techniques could explore the neural correlates of different types of dissociative experiences, potentially identifying biomarkers that distinguish between traumatic and transcendent dissociation.

#### Longitudinal Studies

Long-term studies could track individuals who experience dissociative states, examining how different therapeutic approaches affect their integration and overall well-being. This could help identify which interventions best support healthy integration of these experiences.

#### Cross-Cultural Research

Comparative studies across cultures could examine how different societies understand and respond to dissociative experiences, potentially revealing alternative frameworks for interpretation and integration.

### Limitations and Considerations

#### Avoiding Spiritual Bypassing

While reframing dissociation in contemplative terms offers valuable insights, it's crucial to avoid "spiritual bypassing"—using spiritual concepts to avoid dealing with psychological wounds (Welwood, 2000). Traumatic dissociation often requires specific therapeutic interventions to address underlying trauma.

#### Individual Differences

Not all dissociative experiences will have transcendent dimensions, and individuals vary greatly in their capacity to integrate altered states. Therapeutic approaches must be tailored to each person's unique circumstances and needs.

#### Cultural Sensitivity

The contemplative framework proposed here draws primarily from Eastern traditions. Therapists must be sensitive to clients' cultural backgrounds and avoid imposing foreign spiritual concepts inappropriately.

#### Professional Training

Therapists working with this integrated approach require training in both traditional therapeutic methods and contemplative practices. Without adequate preparation, attempts to work with transcendent dimensions of dissociation could be harmful.

### Conclusion

This paper has argued for a fundamental reframing of dissociative experiences from pathological disconnection to potential association with our true nature. Drawing from Buddhist psychology, Advaita Vedanta, and other contemplative traditions, we have shown that many features of dissociation parallel descriptions of transcendent states of consciousness.

The implications of this reframing are profound. Rather than viewing all dissociative experiences as symptoms to be eliminated, we might recognize some as spontaneous glimpses of our deepest identity—the unchanging awareness that underlies all experience. This doesn't minimize the distress that can accompany these states, but it suggests that healing might involve integration rather than suppression.

The Buddha taught that our fundamental nature is already perfect and complete; suffering arises from not recognizing this truth (Rahula, 1974). If dissociative experiences sometimes represent spontaneous recognition of this fundamental nature, then our therapeutic goal shifts from pathology management to wisdom cultivation.

This paradigmatic shift requires careful implementation, avoiding both the medicalization of spiritual experience and the spiritualization of psychological trauma. But for those ready to explore this territory, it offers a path toward understanding dissociation not as disconnection from ourselves, but as the deepest possible connection—association with the true Self that we have always been.

As the Zen master Huang Po taught: "Your everyday mind—that is the Way!" (Blofeld, 1958). Perhaps what we call dissociation is simply our everyday mind recognizing its own true nature, free from the constructions that usually obscure it. In this recognition lies not pathology, but the possibility of profound healing and awakening.
