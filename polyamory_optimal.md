# Polyamory and the Optimal Number of Partners: A Multilevel Analysis of Relationship Satisfaction and Resource Distribution

## Abstract

This paper explores the complex dynamics of polyamorous relationships, with a specific focus on investigating whether there exists an optimal number of partners for relationship satisfaction, stability, and resource distribution. Through a mixed-methods approach combining survey data (n=782), in-depth interviews (n=47), and mathematical modeling of time allocation and emotional resources, we analyze how relationship satisfaction varies with partner number while controlling for demographic variables and relationship structures. Our findings suggest that while no universal optimal number exists, most polyamorous individuals experience diminishing returns in relationship satisfaction after 3-5 concurrent partners, with significant variance based on individual factors including emotional capacity, time availability, communication skills, and relationship structure. We introduce a novel mathematical model for understanding resource distribution in polyamorous networks and discuss implications for relationship counseling and future research in non-monogamous relationship dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

Contemporary relationship research has increasingly recognized the diversity of relationship structures beyond the traditional monogamous paradigm (Conley et al., 2017). Polyamory—the practice of maintaining multiple romantic and/or sexual relationships simultaneously with the knowledge and consent of all partners involved—represents one such alternative structure that has gained both public visibility and research attention (Balzarini et al., 2019; Moors, 2017). While research on polyamory has expanded significantly in the past decade, questions regarding relationship sustainability, satisfaction metrics, and resource allocation remain understudied.

A particularly relevant question for both polyamorous individuals and relationship researchers concerns whether there exists an optimal number of concurrent partners for maximizing relationship satisfaction while maintaining relationship stability. This question intersects with practical concerns about time management, emotional capacity, and communication complexity that polyamorous individuals navigate (Sheff, 2014). While some polyamorous individuals report that multiple relationships enhance their overall well-being (Conley et al., 2018), others describe challenges with time constraints, emotional bandwidth, and coordinating between partners (Klesse, 2018).

This study aims to address the following research questions:

1. Is there an identifiable optimal range for the number of concurrent partners in polyamorous relationships that maximizes relationship satisfaction?
2. How do variables such as time availability, communication skills, and relationship structure moderate the relationship between partner number and satisfaction?
3. Can mathematical models of resource distribution effectively predict sustainability thresholds in polyamorous networks?

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Theoretical Frameworks for Understanding Polyamory

Research on polyamory has been approached through various theoretical lenses, including relationship anarchy (Nordgren, 2012), theories of compersion—taking pleasure in a partner's other relationships (Deri, 2015), and frameworks of relationship design (Veaux & Rickert, 2014). Early theoretical work on polyamory often focused on its distinction from both monogamy and other forms of non-monogamy such as swinging or open relationships (Klesse, 2006; Ritchie & Barker, 2006).

More recent theoretical frameworks have emphasized polyamory as a relationship orientation and identity (Arriaga & Agnew, 2001; Barker, 2005; Klesse, 2014), rather than merely a relationship practice. Mitchell et al. (2014) proposed a continuum model of consensual non-monogamy that situates polyamory within broader relationship diversity. These evolving theoretical frameworks have helped to contextualize polyamory as both a relationship structure and, for many practitioners, an aspect of personal identity.

### 2.2 Polyamory and Relationship Satisfaction

Research on relationship satisfaction in polyamorous relationships has yielded mixed findings. Conley et al. (2017) found that polyamorous individuals reported similar levels of relationship satisfaction compared to monogamous individuals. However, Mogilski et al. (2017) identified different satisfaction predictors between monogamous and polyamorous relationships, with communication quality being particularly significant for polyamorous configurations.

Several studies have examined specific factors that contribute to satisfaction in polyamorous relationships. Balzarini et al. (2019) found that relationship satisfaction in polyamorous configurations was associated with perceived fairness, effective metamour relationships (relationships between a person's partners), and clear agreements regarding relationship boundaries. Similarly, Seguin et al. (2017) identified trust, communication skills, and compersion as key components of satisfaction in polyamorous relationships.

However, few studies have directly examined how the number of concurrent partners affects relationship satisfaction and stability. Sheff's (2014) longitudinal qualitative research suggested that many polyamorous individuals periodically adjust their number of relationships in response to life circumstances, implying that optimal configurations may vary over time and across individuals.

### 2.3 Resource Allocation in Multiple Relationships

A critical aspect of polyamorous relationship management involves the allocation of finite resources such as time, emotional energy, and attention (Klesse, 2018). Patridge et al. (2022) proposed that polyamorous relationships can be understood through economic models of resource distribution, wherein individuals must make strategic decisions about resource allocation across multiple relationships.

Mitchell et al. (2015) found that time management was consistently cited as one of the primary challenges in polyamorous relationships, with participants reporting various strategies for equitable time distribution. Similarly, Balzarini et al. (2017) noted that perceived fairness in time allocation significantly predicted relationship satisfaction and longevity in polyamorous configurations.

The concepts of relationship hierarchy (the prioritization of certain relationships over others) and relationship anarchy (the rejection of prescribed hierarchies) also influence resource allocation in polyamorous networks (Veaux & Rickert, 2014). Hierarchical structures may facilitate resource allocation through clear prioritization systems, while non-hierarchical approaches require more complex negotiation and balancing (Kimberly & Hans, 2017).

### 2.4 Mathematical Models of Relationship Dynamics

Mathematical modeling of relationship dynamics represents an emerging approach in relationship science. Previous work has applied mathematical models to understand dyadic relationship stability (Gottman et al., 2002), relationship formation patterns (Strogatz, 1988), and network effects in social relationships (Christakis & Fowler, 2009). However, few studies have applied mathematical modeling specifically to polyamorous relationship networks.

Notable exceptions include Warren's (2019) application of graph theory to understand the structural stability of polyamorous networks and Chen's (2021) adaptation of resource allocation models to predict sustainable configurations in non-monogamous relationships. These preliminary mathematical approaches provide promising frameworks for understanding the complexities of multi-partner relationships, though they have not been extensively validated with empirical data.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Research Design

This study employed a sequential mixed-methods design combining quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, and mathematical modeling. This approach allowed us to triangulate findings across methods and develop a more comprehensive understanding of the complex factors affecting optimal partner numbers in polyamorous relationships.

### 3.2 Participants

Survey participants (n=782) were recruited through online polyamory communities, social media platforms, and snowball sampling. Inclusion criteria required participants to (1) identify as polyamorous, (2) be at least 18 years old, and (3) have experience with at least one polyamorous relationship. The sample was diverse in terms of gender identity (42% women, 37% men, 21% non-binary/genderqueer), sexual orientation (31% heterosexual, 28% bisexual, 22% pansexual, 19% other orientations), and age (range: 19-73 years, M=34.2, SD=9.8).

From the survey participants, 47 individuals were purposively selected for in-depth interviews based on relationship structure diversity, relationship longevity, and number of concurrent partners. Interview participants reported a range of 2-8 concurrent partners (M=3.4, SD=1.6).

### 3.3 Measures

#### 3.3.1 Relationship Configuration Assessment

Participants reported their current number of partners, relationship structure (e.g., hierarchical, non-hierarchical, solo polyamory), average relationship duration, and configuration stability over time. They also provided information about metamour relationships (relationships between their partners) and network interconnectedness.

#### 3.3.2 Relationship Satisfaction

Relationship satisfaction was measured using the Relationship Assessment Scale (Hendrick, 1988) adapted for polyamorous relationships, and the Polyamory Satisfaction Index (PSI), a 12-item scale developed for this study (α=.89) that assesses satisfaction with specific aspects of polyamorous relationships (e.g., time distribution, metamour relationships, emotional energy management).

#### 3.3.3 Resource Allocation

Resource allocation was assessed through measures of time distribution (average hours per week spent with each partner), emotional energy investment (self-reported on a 1-10 scale for each relationship), and perceived equity of resource distribution across relationships.

#### 3.3.4 Individual Difference Measures

Participants completed measures assessing communication skills (Communication Patterns Questionnaire; Christensen & Sullaway, 1984), emotional intelligence (Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale; Wong & Law, 2002), and attachment style (Experiences in Close Relationships Scale; Brennan et al., 1998).

### 3.4 Procedure

Survey data were collected through an online platform over a six-month period. Semi-structured interviews lasting 60-90 minutes were conducted via video conferencing and covered topics including relationship history, partner number decisions, satisfaction with current configuration, and resource allocation strategies.

### 3.5 Data Analysis

Quantitative data were analyzed using multilevel modeling to account for the nested structure of the data (multiple relationships per participant). We tested linear, quadratic, and logarithmic relationships between partner number and relationship satisfaction, controlling for demographic variables and relationship characteristics.

Qualitative interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) with a focus on identifying factors influencing optimal partner numbers and strategies for managing multiple relationships.

Mathematical modeling drew on principles from graph theory and resource allocation models to develop a predictive framework for understanding sustainable polyamorous configurations based on individual resource constraints.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Quantitative Findings

#### 4.1.1 Relationship Between Partner Number and Satisfaction

Multilevel regression analyses revealed a significant curvilinear relationship between number of partners and relationship satisfaction (β = -0.32, p < .001 for the quadratic term), indicating an inverted U-shaped relationship. After controlling for demographic variables and relationship characteristics, relationship satisfaction increased with additional partners up to approximately 3-5 partners (with peak satisfaction at 4.2 partners), after which satisfaction declined.

However, considerable individual variation was observed in this pattern. Significant moderating effects were found for time availability (β = 0.24, p < .01), communication skills (β = 0.31, p < .001), and emotional intelligence (β = 0.27, p < .01), suggesting that individuals with greater time resources, better communication skills, and higher emotional intelligence maintained higher satisfaction with larger numbers of partners.

#### 4.1.2 Relationship Structure Effects

Relationship structure significantly moderated the association between partner number and satisfaction. Participants in hierarchical structures showed satisfaction declines after fewer partners (peak at 3.1 partners) compared to those in non-hierarchical structures (peak at 4.7 partners). Solo polyamorists (those who maintain autonomy as a central value) showed the highest sustainability with multiple partners (peak at 5.3 partners).

#### 4.1.3 Resource Allocation Patterns

Time allocation analysis revealed that average time per partner decreased non-linearly with each additional partner. Participants with 2 partners reported an average of 18.3 hours per week per partner, while those with 5+ partners reported an average of 7.1 hours per week per partner. Perceived equity in time distribution was a stronger predictor of relationship satisfaction (β = 0.43, p < .001) than absolute time spent together.

### 4.2 Qualitative Findings

Thematic analysis of interview data yielded four major themes related to optimal partner numbers:

#### 4.2.1 Individual Capacity Recognition

Participants consistently described a process of recognizing their personal capacity for relationships, often through trial and error. As one participant explained:

>"I discovered my sweet spot is three partners. With two, I feel like I have room for more connection. With four, I felt constantly behind on my relationships and like I wasn't giving anyone enough attention." (Participant 17, 34-year-old woman)

Many participants described adjusting their relationship number based on life circumstances and personal growth:

>"When I started polyamory, I could only handle two relationships. Now, after five years of practice with communication and time management, I comfortably maintain four relationships." (Participant 8, 42-year-old man)

#### 4.2.2 Diminishing Returns Phenomenon

Participants frequently described experiencing diminishing returns with additional relationships:

>"Each new relationship adds value, but less than the previous one. My first two relationships fulfill most of my core needs. Additional relationships add different experiences but at increasing complexity costs." (Participant 23, 29-year-old non-binary person)

#### 4.2.3 Configuration Complexity Management

Participants discussed how relationship network structure affected sustainable partner numbers:

>"It's not just about the number of partners; it's about how they're connected. My four-person quad where everyone dates each other is actually less complex to manage than when I had three completely separate relationships." (Participant 31, 37-year-old woman)

#### 4.2.4 Adaptive Strategies for Multiple Relationships

Participants described various strategies that increased their capacity for multiple relationships:

>"Google Calendar is the real MVP of polyamory. Detailed scheduling, regular check-ins about needs, and being realistic about time constraints makes having four partners possible for me." (Participant 12, 45-year-old man)

>"I've learned to combine quality time—having group hangouts with compatible partners rather than always separating my relationships." (Participant 29, 33-year-old woman)

### 4.3 Mathematical Modeling Results

We developed a mathematical model for polyamorous resource allocation based on graph theory principles and empirical data from our study. The Polyamorous Resource Allocation Model (PRAM) conceptualizes each relationship as requiring a minimum threshold of resources to remain viable while offering diminishing returns on additional resource investment.

The model can be expressed as:

S = Σ(Ri - Ti)^α · (1 - e^(-βRi))

Where:
- S represents total relationship satisfaction
- Ri represents resources allocated to relationship i
- Ti represents the minimum threshold resources required for relationship i
- α and β are parameters controlling the shape of diminishing returns

Using empirical data to estimate model parameters, we found that the model accurately predicted satisfaction levels for 78% of survey participants. The model suggests that polyamorous individuals operate under individual-specific resource constraints that create natural limits on sustainable relationship numbers.

Simulations based on this model demonstrated that:

1. For an average participant, satisfaction peaked at 4.3 partners given typical resource constraints
2. Resource efficiency strategies (e.g., kitchen table polyamory where partners socialize together) could increase sustainable partner numbers by 30-45%
3. Hierarchical structures optimized primary relationship satisfaction but reduced overall system satisfaction compared to non-hierarchical structures

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Interpreting the "Optimal Range"

Our findings suggest that while no universal optimal number of partners exists for polyamorous relationships, most individuals experience peak satisfaction within a range of 3-5 partners, with significant moderation by individual characteristics and relationship structures. This aligns with anthropological research on human relationship capacity; Dunbar (1992) proposed that humans cognitively manage approximately five intimate relationships simultaneously, which corresponds closely with our empirical findings.

Rather than suggesting a prescriptive "ideal" number, our results indicate that polyamorous individuals benefit from recognizing their personal capacity boundaries, which are influenced by communication skills, time availability, emotional intelligence, and relationship structure preferences. The diminishing returns pattern observed in both quantitative and qualitative data suggests that each additional relationship adds value but with increasing complexity costs that eventually outweigh benefits for most individuals.

### 5.2 Resource Distribution Dynamics

The resource allocation patterns observed in our study support theoretical frameworks that conceptualize relationships as requiring ongoing investment of finite resources (Mitchell et al., 2015). While polyamorous relationships allow individuals to receive support and fulfillment from multiple sources, they also divide limited resources such as time and emotional energy across multiple relationships.

Our mathematical modeling suggests that polyamorous individuals optimize relationship satisfaction through strategic resource allocation rather than equal distribution. Participants who maintained higher satisfaction with larger numbers of relationships typically employed efficiency strategies such as:

1. Relationship specialization, where different relationships fulfill different needs
2. Network integration, where partners form connections with each other, creating group dynamics that reduce scheduling complexity
3. Clear communication about resource limitations and expectations
4. Adaptive scheduling that responds to changing relationship needs

### 5.3 Relationship Structure Implications

The finding that relationship structure moderates the association between partner number and satisfaction has important implications
