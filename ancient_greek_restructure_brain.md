# Neuroplastic Effects of Ancient Greek Language Acquisition on Brain Structure and Function

## Abstract

This study investigates the neuroplastic effects of Ancient Greek language acquisition on brain structure and cognitive function in adult learners. Using a combination of longitudinal neuroimaging data, cognitive assessments, and linguistic performance metrics, we demonstrate that intensive study of Ancient Greek produces significant structural and functional reorganization in key language-processing regions, with additional effects observed in executive function networks. Our findings suggest that the unique morphosyntactic complexity, phonological system, and conceptual framework of Ancient Greek may induce specific patterns of neural reorganization distinct from those observed in modern language acquisition. These results have implications for understanding linguistic relativity, adult neuroplasticity, and potential cognitive enhancement strategies through targeted language learning.

## Introduction

Language acquisition has long been recognized as a powerful driver of neuroplastic changes in the human brain (Li et al., 2014; Mårtensson et al., 2012). While extensive research has examined how learning modern languages affects neural architecture, less attention has been given to the potential neuroplastic effects of acquiring ancient languages with distinct grammatical structures, phonological systems, and conceptual frameworks that differ markedly from contemporary linguistic environments.

Ancient Greek represents a particularly interesting case for investigating language-induced neuroplasticity due to its rich morphological system, complex syntactic structures, and philosophical lexicon that encodes conceptual distinctions absent in most modern languages (Christidis, 2007). The language features an intricate case system, middle voice constructions, aspiration contrasts, musical pitch accent, and extensive use of participial expressions that demand different cognitive processing strategies compared to analytical languages like English (Joseph, 2009).

Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to investigate how engagement with such linguistically complex systems affects brain structure and function. Previous research has established that language learning induces gray matter density increases in hippocampal and cortical language areas (Mårtensson et al., 2012), enhances white matter tract integrity (Schlegel et al., 2012), and alters functional connectivity patterns (Chai et al., 2016). However, these studies have focused primarily on modern language acquisition, leaving open questions about whether ancient languages with distinctive structural features might induce unique patterns of neural reorganization.

This study addresses this gap by examining the neuroplastic effects of intensive Ancient Greek language acquisition in adult learners over a 10-month period. We hypothesized that the unique grammatical, phonological, and conceptual demands of Ancient Greek would produce distinctive patterns of structural and functional brain changes compared to those documented for modern language learning, potentially involving regions associated with both language processing and executive function.

## Methods

### Participants

Forty-eight healthy right-handed adults (25 female, 23 male; mean age = 27.3 years, SD = 4.6) with no prior knowledge of Ancient Greek participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 32) who underwent intensive Ancient Greek language training or a control group (n = 16) who received matched cognitive stimulation through logical puzzle solving without language content. All participants were native English speakers with comparable educational backgrounds (mean years of education = 16.8, SD = 2.2) and similar baseline cognitive profiles as assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV). No participant had a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, and all gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the University Research Ethics Committee.

### Language Training Protocol

The experimental group underwent a 10-month intensive Ancient Greek language program consisting of 12 hours of formal instruction weekly supplemented by 8 hours of guided independent study. The curriculum followed a progressive structure beginning with alphabet and phonology, advancing through basic morphology and syntax to intermediate reading of authentic texts from various genres including philosophy, drama, and historiography. The control group engaged in a matched cognitive training program focusing on logical puzzles, pattern recognition tasks, and analytical problem-solving activities with equivalent duration and intensity.

### Data Acquisition

#### MRI Data
Structural and functional MRI data were collected at three time points: prior to training (T0), after 5 months of training (T1), and after 10 months of training (T2). All imaging was performed on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head coil. The protocol included:

1. T1-weighted structural imaging (MPRAGE: TR = 2300ms, TE = 2.32ms, flip angle = 8°, FOV = 256mm, 192 sagittal slices, voxel size = 1×1×1mm)
2. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI: 64 directions, b-value = 1000s/mm², 8 b0 images, voxel size = 2×2×2mm)
3. Resting-state functional MRI (TR = 720ms, TE = 33ms, flip angle = 52°, voxel size = 2×2×2mm, 67 slices, 10 minutes)
4. Task-based fMRI during language processing tasks (same parameters as resting-state)

#### Cognitive and Linguistic Assessments
Participants completed a comprehensive battery of cognitive assessments at each time point, including:

1. Verbal working memory (digit span, n-back tasks)
2. Executive function (Stroop task, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Trail Making Test)
3. Verbal fluency (phonemic and semantic)
4. Ancient Greek proficiency (custom assessments of vocabulary, grammar, and reading comprehension)
5. Modern language aptitude (Modern Language Aptitude Test)

### Data Analysis

Structural MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer 7.1 for cortical thickness and volumetric analyses. DTI data were analyzed using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures. Resting-state and task-based functional MRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep and analyzed with both seed-based approaches and independent component analysis to examine functional connectivity patterns.

Statistical analyses employed mixed-effects models to evaluate training-induced changes across time points between groups, controlling for age, gender, and baseline cognitive abilities. Correlational analyses were conducted to examine relationships between structural/functional brain changes and behavioral improvements in language proficiency and cognitive task performance.

## Results

### Structural Brain Changes

Voxel-based morphometry revealed significant gray matter volume increases in the Ancient Greek learners compared to controls after 10 months of training in several brain regions:

1. Left inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and pars opercularis) showed the most pronounced volumetric increases (p < 0.001, FWE-corrected)
2. Left supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus demonstrated significant growth (p < 0.01, FWE-corrected)
3. Bilateral hippocampi exhibited volumetric increases, more pronounced in the left hemisphere (p < 0.01, FWE-corrected)
4. Left superior temporal gyrus showed moderate but significant expansion (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected)

Diffusion tensor imaging revealed increased fractional anisotropy in white matter tracts connecting these regions, particularly in the arcuate fasciculus (p < 0.01, FWE-corrected) and uncinate fasciculus (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected), suggesting enhanced structural connectivity between frontal, temporal, and parietal language regions.

### Functional Changes

Resting-state functional connectivity analyses demonstrated strengthened connections between the left inferior frontal gyrus and temporal language regions in the experimental group compared to controls (p < 0.01, FWE-corrected). Additionally, increased connectivity was observed between traditional language areas and regions associated with executive function, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected).

Task-based fMRI during Ancient Greek reading revealed progressive recruitment of distributed language networks over time. Notably, after 10 months of training, participants showed distinct activation patterns when processing complex syntactic structures (such as genitive absolutes and middle voice constructions) compared to similar complexity structures in English, with greater engagement of right hemisphere homologues of traditional language areas (p < 0.01, FWE-corrected).

### Cognitive-Behavioral Outcomes

Ancient Greek learners demonstrated significant improvements in several cognitive domains beyond language-specific skills:

1. Verbal working memory capacity increased significantly more in the experimental group compared to controls (t = 3.78, p < 0.001)
2. Cognitive flexibility as measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test showed greater improvement in Ancient Greek learners (t = 2.95, p < 0.01)
3. Phonemic verbal fluency demonstrated enhancement in the experimental group (t = 3.42, p < 0.001)
4. Attentional control as measured by the Stroop task showed moderate improvement (t = 2.31, p < 0.05)

Importantly, the degree of structural changes in the left inferior frontal gyrus and arcuate fasciculus significantly predicted proficiency in Ancient Greek grammar comprehension (r = 0.67, p < 0.001), while hippocampal volume changes correlated with vocabulary acquisition (r = 0.58, p < 0.001).

## Discussion

Our findings demonstrate that intensive engagement with Ancient Greek induces substantial neuroplastic changes in the adult brain, affecting both structure and function in language-related neural circuits and beyond. The observed pattern of changes shows both similarities and notable differences compared to those reported in studies of modern language acquisition.

The pronounced volumetric increases in left inferior frontal regions align with previous findings on second language learning (Li et al., 2014; Mårtensson et al., 2012). However, the concurrent expansion of parietal language areas (supramarginal and angular gyri) appears more extensive than typically observed in modern language acquisition, potentially reflecting the increased demands of processing Ancient Greek's complex case system and syntactic structures. As noted by Friederici (2011), these parietal regions play crucial roles in grammatical processing, particularly for morphosyntactically rich languages.

The structural enhancement of the arcuate fasciculus connecting frontal and temporal language regions is consistent with previous findings in language learning (Schlegel et al., 2012), but the additional strengthening of connections to executive function networks represents a novel finding. This may reflect the intense cognitive control demands of navigating Ancient Greek's non-linear sentence structures, where semantic relationships are indicated by morphological markers rather than word order.

The functional reorganization observed during Ancient Greek reading tasks, particularly the increased recruitment of right hemisphere homologues, suggests that processing this ancient language may engage neural resources differently than modern languages. This aligns with Bialystok's (2017) framework proposing that languages with divergent structural properties may induce distinctive patterns of neural adaptation. The enhanced connectivity between language and executive function networks further supports the notion that Ancient Greek's complex structures place additional demands on cognitive control mechanisms.

From a cognitive perspective, the transfer effects to non-linguistic domains, particularly verbal working memory and cognitive flexibility, are noteworthy. These findings support the linguistic relativity hypothesis (Wolff & Holmes, 2011) by suggesting that engaging with Ancient Greek's distinctive conceptual and grammatical framework may reshape cognitive processes beyond language itself. The parallel enhancement of hippocampal structure aligns with research on spatial navigation expertise (Maguire et al., 2000) and suggests that mastering Ancient Greek's complex morphological system may engage similar memory-encoding mechanisms.

Our results have several important implications. First, they provide neurobiological evidence that ancient language learning can serve as a powerful cognitive enhancement intervention, potentially offering neuroprotective benefits. Second, they suggest that the particular structural features of Ancient Greek—its case system, middle voice, participial structures, and philosophical vocabulary—may engage neural resources in ways distinct from modern languages. Finally, they demonstrate that significant neuroplastic changes are possible even in adult brains when provided with appropriately structured linguistic input.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations of this study warrant consideration. First, while our 10-month timeframe allowed observation of substantial neural changes, longer-term follow-up would clarify whether these alterations persist after training cessation. Second, our participant sample consisted primarily of highly educated individuals, potentially limiting generalizability. Third, despite careful matching of training intensity between experimental and control groups, the motivational aspects of language learning versus puzzle solving may have introduced confounding variables.

Future research should address several questions raised by our findings. Comparative studies examining neuroplastic effects across different ancient languages (e.g., Ancient Greek versus Sanskrit or Classical Chinese) could illuminate how specific linguistic features drive neural reorganization. Additionally, investigating potential neuroprotective effects of ancient language learning in aging populations represents a promising direction for clinical applications. Finally, more fine-grained analyses of how specific grammatical structures in Ancient Greek (such as the middle voice or aspect system) engage neural circuitry could provide deeper insights into the relationship between linguistic features and brain function.

## Conclusion

This study provides compelling evidence that intensive acquisition of Ancient Greek induces significant structural and functional reorganization in the adult brain, affecting traditional language networks and extending to executive function systems. The distinctive grammatical structures, phonological patterns, and conceptual framework of Ancient Greek appear to drive unique patterns of neuroplastic changes compared to modern language learning. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the brain's capacity for linguistic adaptation but also suggest potential applications for cognitive enhancement and rehabilitation through targeted language learning programs. As Vygotsky (1962) proposed, language shapes thought; our results suggest this shaping occurs at the neural level and may be particularly profound when engaging with linguistically complex ancient languages.
