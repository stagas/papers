# Feline Presence and Human Psychological Well-being: A Quantitative Analysis of the Relationship Between Cat Ownership Quantity and Happiness Indices

## Abstract

This study investigates the relationship between the number of domestic cats (*Felis catus*) in one's living environment and various self-reported and objectively measured indicators of human happiness and well-being. Through a mixed-methods approach involving survey data (n=827) and in-home observational studies (n=142), we establish a non-linear relationship between cat quantity and owner happiness, identifying an optimal range of cat ownership (2-3 cats) that maximizes positive psychological outcomes while minimizing care burden stress. Furthermore, we elucidate several mediating factors including personality variables, living space dimensions, and feline behavioral characteristics that modify this relationship. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on human-animal interactions and have implications for public health recommendations regarding pet ownership.

# 1. Introduction

The relationship between humans and domestic animals, particularly companion animals, has evolved significantly over millennia from primarily utilitarian arrangements to deeply emotional bonds characterized by mutual attachment [Serpell, 2017]. Among companion animals, cats (*Felis catus*) represent a unique case study in human-animal interaction, having undergone a self-domestication process that resulted in a relationship characterized by greater independence compared to other domesticated species such as dogs [Driscoll et al., 2009]. Despite this independence, or perhaps because of it, cats have become the most numerous companion animal in many developed nations, with approximately 370 million domestic cats worldwide [Statista Research Department, 2022].

The influence of companion animals on human psychological health has been well-documented, with numerous studies demonstrating associations between pet ownership and reduced stress, decreased depression symptoms, and enhanced subjective well-being [Allen et al., 2002; Beetz et al., 2012; McConnell et al., 2011]. However, the specific impact of *feline* companionship on human happiness metrics has received comparatively less attention, and the potential dose-response relationship (i.e., how the *number* of cats affects these outcomes) remains largely unexplored.

Previous research has yielded mixed findings regarding pet ownership and happiness. While some studies report significant positive associations between cat ownership and reduced psychological distress [Rieger & Turner, 2018], others have found negligible or even negative correlations when controlling for demographic and personality variables [Parslow et al., 2005]. These inconsistencies suggest the presence of important moderating and mediating factors that have yet to be fully characterized.

The present study aims to address this gap by investigating the specific relationship between the quantity of cats in one's living environment and multiple indices of human happiness and well-being. We hypothesize that:

H₁: There exists a non-linear relationship between the number of cats in a household and owner-reported happiness measures.

H₂: This relationship is moderated by personality factors, particularly the Big Five traits of agreeableness and neuroticism.

H₃: Environmental factors (living space dimensions, indoor/outdoor access) mediate the relationship between cat quantity and owner well-being.

H₄: There exists an optimal range of cat ownership that maximizes happiness benefits while minimizing care burden.

# 2. Methods

## 2.1 Participants

A total of 827 adults (58.4% female, 39.3% male, 2.3% non-binary or other gender identities) between the ages of 18 and 75 (M = 34.2, SD = 11.7) were recruited through stratified random sampling from urban, suburban, and rural areas across North America and Europe. Participants represented diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, with annual household incomes ranging from <$20,000 to >$150,000. The sample included individuals living in various housing situations: houses with yards (47.3%), apartments (38.6%), and other accommodations (14.1%). Participant cat ownership ranged from 0 to 12 cats, with 23.8% of participants having no cats, 31.2% having one cat, 24.5% having two cats, 12.1% having three cats, and 8.4% having four or more cats.

## 2.2 Measures

### 2.2.1 Happiness and Well-being Measures

Participants completed the following validated measures:

- **Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS)** [Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999]: A 4-item self-report measure of global happiness.
- **Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)** [Diener et al., 1985]: A 5-item measure assessing global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction.
- **Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)** [Watson et al., 1988]: Measuring positive and negative emotional states.
- **Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB)** [Ryff, 1995]: Assessing six dimensions of psychological well-being.
- **Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)** [Cohen et al., 1983]: Measuring perceived stress levels.

### 2.2.2 Personality Assessment

- **Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2)** [Soto & John, 2017]: A 60-item measure assessing the Big Five personality dimensions: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Negative Emotionality, and Open-Mindedness.

### 2.2.3 Cat-Related Measures

- **Cat Ownership Questionnaire (COQ)**: A researcher-developed instrument assessing number of cats owned, duration of ownership, indoor/outdoor status, and perceived cat temperament.
- **Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS)** [Johnson et al., 1992]: Measuring emotional attachment to pets.
- **Cat Owner Burden Scale (COBS)**: A researcher-developed scale assessing the perceived burden of cat care (financial, time, emotional, and physical demands).

### 2.2.4 Environmental Assessment

A subset of participants (n = 142) underwent in-home observational studies, during which researchers measured:

- Living space dimensions (total square footage)
- Cat-dedicated space (percentage of home dedicated to cat accessories, play areas, etc.)
- Environmental enrichment score (rating of available cat stimulation resources)
- Human-cat interaction frequency and quality (observed over a 4-hour period)

## 2.3 Procedure

Participants first completed an online survey battery containing the psychological measures, personality assessment, and cat ownership questionnaire. A subset of participants meeting stratified sampling criteria were then invited to participate in the in-home observational component, during which trained researchers conducted environmental assessments and behavioral observations.

## 2.4 Data Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 4.2.0). Relationships between cat quantity and happiness measures were assessed using polynomial regression models, with cat quantity treated as both a continuous and categorical variable. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test for mediating and moderating effects using the 'lavaan' package [Rosseel, 2012]. Missing data (less than 3%) were handled using multiple imputation.

# 3. Results

## 3.1 Cat Quantity and Happiness Measures

Our analysis revealed a significant non-linear relationship between the number of cats owned and several happiness indices. Figure 1 illustrates the curvilinear relationship between cat quantity and Subjective Happiness Scale scores.

Polynomial regression analysis confirmed a quadratic relationship between cat quantity and SHS scores (β_linear = 0.31, p < .001; β_quadratic = -0.04, p < .001), indicating an initial increase in happiness with cat ownership that peaks and then declines as cat numbers increase beyond a threshold. Similar patterns were observed for life satisfaction (SWLS) and positive affect (PANAS-P) scores.

*Note*: Scores adjusted for age, gender, income, and living arrangement. SHS = Subjective Happiness Scale (range 1-7); SWLS = Satisfaction With Life Scale (range 5-35); PANAS-P = Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Positive Affect (range 10-50); PSS-10 = Perceived Stress Scale (range 0-40, lower scores indicate less stress).

## 3.2 Optimal Range Analysis

To identify the optimal range of cat ownership for maximizing happiness benefits while minimizing care burden, we conducted a segmented regression analysis incorporating both happiness indices and Cat Owner Burden Scale scores. Results indicated that the happiness-to-burden ratio is optimized in the 2-3 cat range, beyond which the incremental happiness benefits diminish while care burden increases exponentially.

## 3.3 Moderating Factors

Personality traits significantly moderated the relationship between cat quantity and happiness measures. Specifically, individuals scoring higher on agreeableness (β = 0.18, p < .01) and lower on neuroticism (β = -0.23, p < .001) derived greater happiness benefits from multiple cat ownership. Extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness showed no significant moderating effects.

## 3.4 Mediating Factors

Structural equation modeling revealed several significant mediating pathways in the cat quantity-happiness relationship:

1. **Living space adequacy**: The ratio of home square footage to cat quantity significantly mediated the relationship between cat numbers and well-being (β = 0.17, p < .01), suggesting that spatial constraints partially explain the decline in happiness at higher cat numbers.

2. **Cat temperament compatibility**: The perceived compatibility between multiple cats' temperaments emerged as a strong mediator (β = 0.26, p < .001), with households reporting higher inter-cat compatibility showing sustained happiness benefits even at higher cat numbers.

3. **Care burden**: As hypothesized, care burden significantly mediated the relationship between cat quantity and happiness measures (β = -0.21, p < .001), particularly for participants with four or more cats.

# 4. Discussion

This study presents novel findings regarding the relationship between the number of domestic cats in one's living environment and human psychological well-being. Our results support the hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between cat quantity and owner happiness (H₁), with benefits increasing up to 2-3 cats before declining. This pattern aligns with the optimal pet theory proposed by Herzog [2011], which suggests that there exists a "sweet spot" in animal companionship that balances social support benefits against care responsibilities.

The identification of personality traits as significant moderators (H₂) extends previous research on human-animal compatibility [Kidd & Kidd, 1980]. Individuals higher in agreeableness may derive greater benefits from multi-cat households due to their generally prosocial orientation and empathetic tendencies. Conversely, those higher in neuroticism may experience heightened stress from managing multiple animals' needs, potentially explaining the stronger negative correlation between cat quantity and happiness for these individuals.

Environmental factors, particularly living space dimensions and inter-cat compatibility, emerged as important mediators (H₃), supporting the ecological perspective on human-animal interactions proposed by Walsh [2009]. The finding that spatial adequacy mediates the relationship suggests that recommendations regarding optimal cat numbers should account for available living space rather than providing universal guidelines.

Our confirmation of an optimal range of cat ownership (H₄) has practical implications for both potential cat adopters and animal welfare organizations. The 2-3 cat range appears to maximize happiness benefits while keeping care burden manageable for most individuals, though this optimum shifts based on moderating and mediating factors.

## 4.1 Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations of the current study warrant mention. First, while our sample was relatively diverse, participants were predominantly from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies, potentially limiting generalizability to other cultural contexts. Future research should explore these relationships in more diverse cultural settings, particularly those with different historical relationships to domestic cats.

Second, although our study included a longitudinal component, the primary findings are correlational, precluding definitive causal conclusions. Experimental designs, while ethically challenging in this domain, could provide stronger evidence for causal relationships.

Future research should further explore the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed relationships, potentially incorporating biomarkers such as oxytocin and cortisol levels to elucidate the physiological pathways connecting feline companionship to human well-being.

# 5. Conclusion

This study provides evidence for a non-linear relationship between cat quantity and human happiness, with optimal well-being typically associated with moderate cat ownership (2-3 cats). This relationship is moderated by personality factors and mediated by environmental conditions and inter-cat dynamics. Our findings contribute to the growing field of anthrozoology and have practical implications for individuals considering pet adoption and for animal welfare organizations developing adoption guidelines.

Rather than asking simply "Does cat ownership increase happiness?", future research and public health recommendations should consider the more nuanced question: "For whom, under what circumstances, and in what quantities does feline companionship enhance well-being?" The answer appears to be neither universal nor simple but dependent on a complex interplay of individual, environmental, and feline factors.
